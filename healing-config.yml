# Self-healing Configuration (YAML)
# This file controls the AI-powered healing engine for stable tests.

# Main switch for the self-healing system
enabled: true

# Whether to capture the 'Golden State' of successful elements (for RAG/History)
captureGoldenState: false

# Enable semantic-based matching strategies
semanticEnabled: true

# In-memory cache for speed (Global for the current JVM run)
cacheEnabled: false

# RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) based healing
ragEnabled: false

# Semantic strategy mode: 
# - LEGACY: Previous algorithm
# - HYBRID: Advanced combination (Recommended)
semanticMode: "HYBRID"

# Confidence Calculation Mode:
# - SAFE: Prioritizes overall stability (Mean > Max). Best for stable sites.
# - RECKLESS: Prioritizes the best single indicator (Max > Mean). Best for high-refactor sites.
healingMode: "RECKLESS"

# Execution Mode for candidate scoring:
# - SINGLE: Sequential processing (Standard)
# - PARALLEL: Multi-threaded processing (Faster for large DOMs)
executionMode: "PARALLEL"

# Maximum threads to use in PARALLEL mode (prevents CPU exhaustion)
maxHealingThreads: 4
